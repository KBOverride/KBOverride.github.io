  <h1 class="title"> Comparison between George Orwell's "1984" and today </h1>

  <article class="wrapper">  
    <div class="content">

    <h3>"1984"</h3>
    <p class="pRB">George Orwell's "1984" is an astonishing book on political discussions and rising technology. In the <a href="http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/1984/context.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">context</a>, a totalitarian society exists where everyone is under watch called "Big Brother". Everyone is monitored to the max potential in order to have a perfect society. In my insight, I will talk about the comparison about the universe inside "1984" and today's year, 2016. </p>

    <h3>Privacy</h3>
    <p class="pRB">Privacy is something that we should all have the right to whenever we do something. It means that if a person has privacy, they are free from the disturbance of other people. In my opinion, privacy hold an important meaning in life and should be taken more seriously. When we have privacy, it feels good to do whatever we want to do without anyone else interfering. However, the previous statement would apply only if you are doing something morally right and nothing illegal. If we use privacy in a professional setting, we can see that privacy gives trust between workers in different parties agreeing to a business transaction. One worker trusts the other worker and avoids breaching the other worker's personal information when working together.</p>

    <p class="pRB">Respecting another person's privacy shows that the other person will be respectful back at you. For example, I don't want to over hear that person's conversation on how that person's relative died. It is disrespectful to that person and may cause psychological harm to that person.</p>

    <p class="pRB">In the book, 1984, we can see that no one has any privacy in that particular society. Lots of posters exist with the words, "Big Brother is watching you". <a href="https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/1984/themes.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Big Brother</a> is a symbol for the party's ruler or perhaps represents the party's principles. When you see the face on the poster, his eyes gaze right on yours which means he knows whatever you are doing but also can protect you. We can relate this to the real world where the NSA represents "Big Brother".</p>

    <p class="pRB">The <a href="http://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/National-Security-Agency" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NSA</a> is responsible for tapping into people's phones and computers. They are invading into people's privacy in order to protect against high level threats including terrorism and cyber terrorism. I think that the actions of NSA are considered to go against privacy and to prevent it from ever existing in the real world. I wouldn't want someone to be listening to my conversation with my mom over the phone and have it to be disclosed, leaked or hacked. I would feel angry and upset over the fact that my privacy has been taken away from me. Privacy should be available to everyone and not be taken away so easily.</p>

    <h3>Advanced Technology</h3>
    <p class="pRB">Technology has been advancing rapidly over the years and is represented in the book, "1984". The book explains how they use big screens and hidden microphones to look over the society and its people. Again, this invades the privacy of someone else and prevents people from doing secret actions. When advanced technology gets in the hands of people, they have a lot of power compared to those with old technology.</p>

    <p class="pRB">In 2016, technology is advancing at an alarming rate and we have technology that surpasses human expectations. Let's take a look at AI in particular. AI stands for Artificial Intelligence which means that machines have intelligence. Over the past years, we have had smart cars which drive themselves. Determining how reliable they are is one problem that needs solving. If I put myself in a self-driven car, I would not rely on the car to drive safely every time. I would be scared and terrified of the experience at first but gradually over continued use, I would say that these self-driven cars work safely without harming its passengers.</p>



    <p class="pRB">Robot workers are another type of advanced technology that exists today in factories. When I first heard of these workers, I had to see videos of them on YouTube. I was surprised of how sophisticated and efficient the robots performed in a factory. They were able to piece together car parts twice as fast as human workers would do. In my opinion, these robot workers are wrong because they have replaced normal humans which means that labour jobs have been replaced. However, this has created new jobs in AI, machine learning, and advanced algorithms in the area of computer science. In the end, I think that companies are finding ways to make more money and thus not caring about humans and how they endure their way of life.</p>

    <h3>North Korea</h3>
    <p class="pRB">When I look at a country like North Korea, the first thing that comes in my mind is the way the information is censored. Information related to the media is censored to the point where the government only regulates it. In fact, the media is in the form of propaganda praising its leader. This relates to the book because of how brainwashed the party is to its people. The book explains how they use mind control in combination with constant physical exercises to control its people. This is the same situation in North Korea where everyone is brainwashed and controlled through various methods.</p>


    <p class="pRB">In North Korea, its people are <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/17/north-korea-human-rights-abuses-stories-un-brainwashed" target="_blank" rel="noopener">brainwashed</a> to the point where they have to be forced to cry when a significant relative of a leader dies. If they do not cry, they will be punished with torture or even death. In terms of censorship, media in the form of news is regulated but also the Internet cannot be used by its people because the Internet is only for its military. This is exactly the situation we see all the time in the book, "1984". Constant regulation, brainwashing, and propaganda both exist in the book and North Korea.</p>

    <p class="pRB">When I look at a country like North Korea, I can't imagine me living there at all. I would rather die than be tortured through propaganda, no internet, heavy censorship, and the fact that the country is behind in terms of technology. I do not like the way the people are treated so unfairly which disgusts me. I cannot think of one good reason to go and live there for the rest of my life. The way it operates, the government officials, and the precious lives of the citizens need to be changed now. The constant pain and suffering would be too much and I wish that North Korea would be a different country than it is today.</p>
