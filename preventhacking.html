    <h3>What is considered Computer Hacking?</h3>
    <p class="pRB">In this modern day and age, people are susceptible to all kinds of attacks ranging from physical attacks such as assault to mental attacks such as bullying a person with name calling. Now, there's a different kind of attack where the person doesn't know he/she is being attacked. This type of attack is called <a href="http://cyber.laws.com/hacking" target="_blank" rel="noopener">computer hacking</a>. Computer hacking attacks occur when an individual attempts to modify or alter computer hardware and software to accomplish a goal that is not near the idea of the creator's original goal. The individual is known as a "hacker" and has an expert level of knowledge about computers and computer programming.</p>

    <h3><strong>DDoS Attacks</strong></h3>
    <p class="pRB">Many of the computer hacks are different. Here are the most common hacks and how to prevent them from happening to you. Let's take a look at an easy yet common hack called <a href="http://criminal.laws.com/computer-crime/associated-crimes/denial-of-service-attacks/denial-of-service-attacks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Denial-of-Service</a>. This attack occurs when the attacker attempts to take down a website or some type of server with a lot of traffic directed to it. The main goal is to disrupt the service(s) and ultimately make the server not process any requests thus crashing the server. On the other hand, a DDoS attack is when an attacker uses a botnets to flood the server with constant requests. Here are is one way to prevent DDoS attacks:</p>

    <h4><strong>1. Call your ISP</strong></h4>
    <p class="pRB">Calling your ISP can be one way to get help if you are suspected to being under a DDoS attack by someone else. By keeping the ISP's phone number near you, you can quickly call them and hopefully when you talk to them, they already detected the attack themselves. Unfortunately, if you run web server yourself instead of a hosting server, you have a lesser chance of withstanding the DDoS attack so that is something to consider. Most of the time, data centres have higher bandwidth than your systems and the employees at the centres will have more experience dealing with the attacks. What the ISP will do to stop the attack is null routing the packets that are meant for your web server. This means that the packets should be dropped before arriving to the destination. The ISP will likely try to stop the attack as it causes high bandwidth to their systems.</p>

    <h3><strong>Keyloggers </strong></h3>
    <p class="pRB"><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/180615/keyloggers-explained-what-you-need-to-know/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Keylogger</a> is a software/program that records the order of keystrokes of another person's keyboard and then saves a file of those keystrokes for the attacker to look at. This is especially dangerous for the user because the attacker can gain access to the user's account when the user logs into his/her websites. Bank information, social media, and email address accounts can be accessed by the attacker causing financial disasters.</p>

    <p class="pRB">I think that a user needs to be more careful what they are typing and be aware of their account activity when online. Here is a story on how a student uses a keylogger to upgrade his marks via the school staff accounts. In my opinion, this is highly unethical and immoral as it invades the privacy of the school staff and the student upgraded his marks with so little effort in the courses. Here are some tips to prevent keyloggers being installed on your computer.</p>

    <h4><strong>1. Use a password manager</strong></h4>
    <p class="pRB">Using a password manager to store passwords can stop keylogger attacks because if nothing is typed, then how can the attacker know the password? Automatic filling in the passwords is a great way to prevent passwords being stolen.</p>

    <h4><strong>2. Using a Firewall</strong></h4>
    <p class="pRB">Everyone should be using a <a href="http://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/firewall" target="_blank" rel="noopener">firewall</a> in today's modern society. It can detect a program that would send information over the network. Thus, the firewall would display some sort of warning or permission for the program to commit to sending the data out. That is when the user should immediately know that an attack is happening and click on deny so the firewall would stop the traffic from flowing.</p>

    <h4><strong>3. Updating software</strong></h4>
    <p class="pRB">Updating software should be a number one priority on the computer. An exploit could be found where a user can install keylogger software on malicious websites. However, when software is updated, the exploit is fixed and can no longer occur. There are some programs out there that automatically find and update software so that user doesn't have to manually find and update them.</p>

    <h3><strong>Phishing Attacks </strong></h3>
    <p class="pRB">Phishing is another common attack that occurs on everyday use of computers. An attacker in this situation would impersonate someone or an organization and send a spoof link to someone else via email for example. The user would click on the link and follow the instructions such as entering information. From there, the website actually installs a trojan on the user's computer without the user knowing. There are some ways in which you can prevent this:</p>

    <h4><strong>1. Don't click unrecognizable links or download files from unknown senders</strong></h4>
    <p class="pRB">A common mistake people do is when they receive a new email, they always open it and download the attachments without looking at it properly. This can be devastating as the sender can be an impersonator and pretend to be someone from a well known bank. The user would download a trojan unknowingly so always be careful when looking at the email. Try to look at the email address, look at what the content of the email is saying, and ask yourself this, "Were you expected to receive the email in the first place?".</p>

    <h4><strong>2. Receive and send information only on secure websites</strong></h4>
    <p class="pRB">People don't realize that they are sending information over insecure websites. Look at the top left URL to see if it is "https" where the "s" stands for "secure". You should <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> send personal information over a URL with <a href="https://www.instantssl.com/ssl-certificate-products/https.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">"http" instead of "https"</a>. Over "https", the information between the website and browser are encrypted.</p>

    <h3><strong>Unencrypted cookies and the theft of cookies</strong></h3>
    <p class="pRB"><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/webwise/guides/about-cookies" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cookies</a> are responsible for storing information from a browser such as passwords, history of browsers, and also usernames. The hackers would steal your cookies in the browser and then access everything stored in the cookies. They do this in the form of something called cross site scripting. They form a link which the user clicks on and the user would think it's a valid link. The link is actually malicious and the data sent in that link goes to the hacker but the user still thinks it's a valid link from the website. From there, the hacker can hijack the user's session and steal the cookies of that user. Here is one way to prevent the theft of cookies:</p>

    <h4><strong>1. Watch out the links you click on and clear your cookies often</strong></h4>
    <p class="pRB">A lot of people blindly click the agree button when agreeing to the website using cookies. What they don't realize is that the cookies can store personal or sensitive information of that user. When the user blindly clicks links all over the place, the website tracks it. In a google search, the user may think they are going to a legitimate website but it could actually be a fake website.</p>

      <img class="feature-image" src="images/cookie-monster.jpg" alt="Cookie Monster" />

    </figure>

    <p class="pRB">Clicking on the right links makes the user much more aware of what the website content contains so make sure to go to the main website and use the search feature from there instead of the Google search. Clearing cookies is one way to prevent anything going to the hackers. In my experience, I rarely use cookies at all because I want privacy when viewing a website and this lessens the chance of the theft of cookies since there won't be any personal or financial information stored in the cookies.</p>

    <h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>
    <p class="pRB">There are many more sophisticated and efficient attacks out there but my point is to make the user more aware when using a computer. It's like how in the physical world where users are more aware of their surroundings when visiting another country. They can apply the same principles when using a computer. Therefore, I hope to see an improvement where there are less attacks happening to users. They should stop being lazy and do more research into computer terms and literacy. The more a user understands how the internet and computer works, the more they can spot attacks and ultimately preventing them.</p>
